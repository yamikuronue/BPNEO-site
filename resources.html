				<p>One of the fundamental textbooks to be familiar with, this book launched a whole movement (usually called HAES) around pursuing health without pursuing weight loss. This is only one part of body positivity, but it lays the groundwork for a lot of what we do.</p>

				<p>This relatively new book is practical, flippant, and fun. It guides you through journal exercises and teaches you how to be kind to your body again after so many years of shaming yourself and dieting.</p>

		    <h3>Blogs</h3>
		    There are so many great voices in the blogosphere around body positivity, intuitive eating, and fat acceptance that it's hard to list even a representative sample. Here are my personal favorites:
	    </div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
	    <ul class="col-md-8 offset-md-1">
	    	<li><a href="https://thefuckitdiet.com/">The "Fuck It" Diet</a> by Caroline describes her favorite diet: "fuck it, I'm going to eat what I want". She also holds classes entitled "Be Your Own Damn Guru".</li>
	        <li><a href="https://medium.com/@thefatshadow">Your Fat Friend</a> writes letters explaining what it's like to be fat and why fatphobia is such a big deal. A must-read for any of our thin members about thin privilege!</li>
	        <li><a href="https://thebodyisnotanapology.com/">This Body Is Not An Apology</a> publishes a variety of articles, all based around radical self-love. It covers race, weight, gender, sexuality, and mental health, and that's only the beginning!</li>
	        <li><a href="http://www.themilitantbaker.com/">The Militant Baker</a>, also known as Jes Baker, blogs about food, mental health, and kittens. Everyone loves kittens! For a good tastes, start with her wildly popular entry <a href="http://www.themilitantbaker.com/2013/03/things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls-so-i.html">Things No-one Will Tell Fat Girls (So I Will)</a></li>
	        <li><a href="https://danceswithfat.wordpress.com/">Dances With Fat</a> is the home of Ragen Chastain, a fat athelete training who has run marathons and is training for a triathelon. She's witty, irreverant, and often decorates her blog posts with pictures of pugs.</li>
	        <li><a href="http://www.youaintyourweight.com/blog/">You Ain't Your Weight</a> is a celebration of who you can be when you're not busy being worried about your weight.</li>
	        <li><a href="https://www.edinstitute.org/blog/">The Eating Disorder Institute</a>, formerly known as Your Etopia, updates less frequently than the others I've listed here, but when it does I devour every post. These posts are scientific, well-researched, and detailed; they have pioneered a treatment method for eating disorders called the Homeodynamic Treatment Method.</li>
	    </ul>

		    <h3>Podcasts</h3>
		    A lot of the bloggers above have podcasts, but here are my favorites of the bunch:
	    </div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
	    <ul class="col-md-8 offset-md-1">
	    	<li><a href="https://www.christyharrison.com/foodpsych/">Food Psyche</a> by Christy Harrison is a series of interviews. She came to body positivity from doing the podcast; originally, she just began by asking people about their relationship with food, and slowly came to realize that there had to be a better way. Today she interviews mostly dietitions, nutritionists, and body positive experts.</li>
	    	<li><a href="http://www.bodykindnessbook.com/podcast/">Body Kindness</a>. Rebecca Scritchfield is such a bright, sunny person, I can listen to her talk all day. She tends to do interviews, and her ongoing series working with one of the Biggest Loser contestants after he regained the weight and began eating intuitively is fascinating.</li>
